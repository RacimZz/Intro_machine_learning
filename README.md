## Image Processing with Python

### Description
This Jupyter Notebook performs basic image processing tasks using Python. It primarily utilizes `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scikit-image` for various operations on an image file (`TP04.jpg`).

### Features
- **Image Loading**: Reads and displays the original image.
- **Normalization**: Scales pixel values between 0 and 1.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the image to grayscale for further processing.
- **Color Inversion**: Inverts grayscale pixel values.

### Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy scikit-image
```

### Usage
Run the notebook cell by cell to visualize the transformations applied to the image.
